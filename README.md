# ðŸ’£ Rock vs Mine Prediction App

This is a **Streamlit web app** that predicts whether a sonar signal represents a **Rock (ðŸª¨)** or a **Mine (ðŸ’£)** object, based on 60 frequency-based sonar readings. It uses a trained machine learning model (`model4.pkl`) to make real-time predictions.

## ðŸ§­ Overview

This app uses the [UCI Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)) which contains:

- **208 samples**
- **60 features** per sample (sonar energy levels at different frequency bands)
- **Binary classification target**:  
  - **`R`** for Rock  
  - **`M`** for Mine

Users input the 60 sonar frequency values, and the app instantly predicts whether it's a Rock or Mine using a trained ML model.
